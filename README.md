## üéØ What is SCASTD?

**SCASTD** (Statistical Casting Daemon) is a lightweight, high-performance statistics collection and analytics engine we designed specifically for streaming media infrastructure. Unlike traditional streaming servers, we built SCASTD to be the definitive monitoring solution that bridges legacy and modern streaming protocols, providing unified analytics across your entire streaming ecosystem.

### Why We Built This

As DevSecOps professionals with over 20 years of combined experience in streaming media infrastructure, we consistently encountered the challenge of collecting unified statistics from diverse streaming server implementations. Traditional monitoring tools either focused on single protocols or provided basic metrics without the depth needed for professional streaming operations. That's why we created SCASTD - to provide:

```c
/*
 * scastd_core.h - Statistical Collection Engine Architecture
 * Authors: oddsock, dstjohn (David St. John)
 * Created: Project inception
 * Purpose: We designed this daemon to efficiently collect statistics from multiple
 *          streaming protocols and provide unified analytics through modern APIs
 * 
 * Key Design Principles We Implemented:
 * - Protocol-agnostic statistics collection
 * - Real-time data aggregation and analysis
 * - Modern RESTful API with JSON/XML output
 * - Multi-database backend support for scalability
 * - Enterprise-grade logging and monitoring
 * - Security-first approach with authentication
 */

// We structured the daemon with these core capabilities:
typedef struct {
    char* target_servers[];      // We monitor multiple server types simultaneously
    int polling_intervals[];     // We configure collection frequency per server
    database_config_t backends; // We support multiple database backends
    api_config_t rest_api;      // We serve statistics via modern HTTP APIs
    logging_config_t logging;   // We provide comprehensive operational logging
    security_config_t auth;     // We implement token-based authentication
} scastd_engine_t;
```

### What Makes SCASTD Unique

Based on our decades of experience with streaming infrastructure, we engineered SCASTD with these distinguishing characteristics that set it apart from traditional monitoring solutions:

**Protocol Unification**: We implement native support for SHOUTcast v1/v2, Icecast2, and legacy ICY protocols, providing a single interface to monitor heterogeneous streaming environments. This eliminates the need for multiple monitoring tools and provides consistent metrics across different server types.

**Real-time Analytics Engine**: We built a sophisticated statistics aggregation system that not only collects current metrics but also performs historical analysis, trend detection, and predictive analytics. This gives streaming operators the insights they need to optimize performance and plan capacity.

**Enterprise Integration Ready**: We designed SCASTD with modern DevOps practices in mind, providing native integration with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, and other monitoring platforms. The RESTful API design ensures seamless integration with existing infrastructure monitoring systems.

**Scalable Architecture**: We implemented a multi-threaded collection engine with configurable polling intervals and database connection pooling, allowing SCASTD to monitor hundreds of streaming servers while maintaining low resource consumption.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Understanding Our Development Workflow

Before diving into installation, it's important to understand how we structure our development process. We maintain three distinct branches that serve different purposes in our engineering pipeline:

- **`master` Branch**: Our production-ready code that undergoes our ProductionBuildDeployment pipeline
- **`dev` Branch**: Our active development branch running the DevelopmentBuildPipeline for integration testing
- **`future` Branch**: Our experimental features branch using the FutureBuildPipeline for cutting-edge development

This three-tier approach allows us to maintain stability in production while continuously innovating and testing new features.

### Prerequisites We Recommend

Before building SCASTD, we suggest ensuring your system has the necessary development tools and libraries. Based on our experience across different platforms, here's what you'll need:

make -j$(nproc)

echo "üß™ Running test suite..."
# We always run tests to ensure build quality
make check

echo "‚úÖ Build completed successfully!"
echo "üìç Binary location: ./src/scastd"
```

### üì• Installing Pre-built Packages

#### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
```bash
sudo dpkg -i scastd_<version>_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

#### macOS (.pkg installer)
```bash
sudo installer -pkg scastd-<version>.pkg -target /
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)
Release archives include a `scastd.rb` Homebrew formula. To test it locally:

```bash
brew install --formula ./scastd.rb
brew services start scastd
```

Once verified, install from the official tap:

```bash
brew tap davestj/scastd
brew install scastd
```

To update the formula later:

```bash
brew upgrade scastd
```

To remove it:

```bash
brew uninstall scastd
```

For details on creating the macOS package or Homebrew formula yourself, see
[packaging/macos/README.md](packaging/macos/README.md).

### üöÄ Post-Installation Steps

#### Edit `scastd.conf`
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo nano /etc/scastd/scastd.conf`
- **macOS (.pkg)**: `sudo nano /usr/local/etc/scastd.conf`
- **macOS (Homebrew)**: `nano /opt/homebrew/etc/scastd.conf`

Update absolute paths for databases and certificates as needed.

#### Start and verify the service
- **Debian/Ubuntu**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable scastd
sudo systemctl start scastd
```
- **macOS (Homebrew)**
```bash
brew services start scastd
```
- **macOS (.pkg)**
```bash
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.scastd.plist
```

Confirm the daemon responds:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/status.json
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/status.xml
```
Expected responses:
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```
```xml
<status>ok</status>
```
Troubleshooting tips if unreachable:
- Check service state: `sudo systemctl status scastd` or `brew services list`
- Ensure the configured port matches the `curl` command
- Verify no firewall or other service blocks the port
- Review logs in `/var/log/scastd` or with `journalctl -u scastd`

#### Explore command-line options
```bash
scastd --help
```
```text
Usage: scastd [options]
  -h, --help           Show this help and exit
  -c, --config PATH    Configuration file
  -D, --daemon         Run as a daemon
      --pid-file PATH  PID file path (used with --daemon)
      --ip ADDRESS     Bind IP address
      --port PORT      HTTP server port
      --debug LEVEL    Debug level
      --poll INTERVAL  Poll interval (e.g., 60s, 5m)
      --test-mode      Validate configuration and exit
      --db-type TYPE   Database type
      --db-host HOST   Database host
      --db-port PORT   Database port
      --db-name NAME   Database name

      --ssl-cert PATH  SSL certificate file
      --ssl-key PATH   SSL key file
      --ssl-enable     Enable SSL
      --dump           Dump database and exit
      --dump-dir DIR   Directory for database dump
```

#### Enable HTTPS mode
Run with certificate options:
```bash
scastd --ssl-enable \
       --ssl-cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem \
       --ssl-key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
```
Or configure `scastd.conf`:
```conf
ssl_enable     true
ssl_cert       /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
ssl_key        /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
```
On macOS the Homebrew prefix contains the certificates:
```conf
ssl_enable     true
ssl_cert       /usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
ssl_key        /usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
# Use /opt/homebrew on Apple¬†Silicon
```

#### Test HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/status.json
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/status.xml
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/uptime
curl -k https://localhost:8000/v1/status.json
curl https://example.com:8000/v1/status.json
```

#### Obtain TLS certificates
*Debian/Ubuntu*
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com
```
*macOS (Homebrew)*
```bash
brew install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com
```
Certificates are placed under the Let's Encrypt directory for your
platform:

| Platform | Certificate path |
| --- | --- |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/` |
| macOS (Intel) | `/usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `/opt/homebrew/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/` |

Reference `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` from that directory in
`scastd.conf` and restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart scastd      # or reload
brew services restart scastd       # macOS
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

We designed SCASTD's configuration system to be both powerful and intuitive. The daemon supports multiple configuration methods to accommodate different deployment scenarios and security requirements.

### Configuration Files We Support

SCASTD reads settings from configuration files that support environment variable overrides - a pattern we've found essential in containerized and cloud-native environments:

- **[scastd.conf](scastd.conf)** - Main configuration file with comprehensive settings
- **[scastd_pg.conf](scastd_pg.conf)** - PostgreSQL-specific configuration example

Console logging is enabled by default when SCASTD runs in the foreground. Running with `--daemon` disables console output unless `log_console true` is set in the configuration. Set `log_console false` to silence console logs even in foreground mode.

### Environment Variable Integration

We implement robust environment variable support for sensitive data and containerized deployments:

```bash
# Environment variables we recognize for secure configuration
export SCASTD_USERNAME="statistics_user"
export SCASTD_PASSWORD_FILE="/run/secrets/db_password"
export SCASTD_MARIADB_HOST="mariadb-cluster.internal"
export SCASTD_API_TOKEN_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-here"
export ICEADMINUSER="admin"
export ICEUSERPASS="hackme"
```

These credentials configure access to the Icecast administrative interface. If
`ICEADMINUSER` or `ICEUSERPASS` are not provided, the daemon falls back to the
legacy `SCASTD_ADMINUSER` and `SCASTD_USERPASS` variables.

For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to our comprehensive [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

---

## üîå API Reference & Integration

We designed SCASTD's HTTP API following RESTful principles with comprehensive authentication and rate limiting. The API serves statistics on port 8333 by default, with versioned endpoints to ensure backward compatibility.

### Core API Endpoints We Provide

Our API offers several categories of endpoints designed for different use cases:

**Statistics Collection Endpoints**: Access real-time and historical streaming server metrics
**Health Monitoring Endpoints**: Check daemon status and perform health verification
**Configuration Endpoints**: Manage monitored servers and collection settings
**Export Endpoints**: Generate reports in various formats (JSON, XML, CSV)

### Integration Examples We Support

We provide ready-to-use integration examples for popular monitoring platforms:

- **Prometheus Integration**: Native metrics export for Prometheus scraping
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-built dashboards for streaming analytics
- **ELK Stack Integration**: Structured logging for Elasticsearch ingestion
- **Custom API Clients**: Example implementations in Python, PHP, and Node.js

For complete API documentation and integration examples, see our [API Documentation](docs/CI.md).

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance
