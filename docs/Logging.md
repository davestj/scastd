# Logging Configuration

Scastd can write access, error, and debug information to separate log
files and optionally forward messages to a remote syslog server. The
following configuration keys control logging behaviour. Paths may be
absolute or relative to `log_dir`.

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `log_dir` | `./logs` | Directory where log files are stored. |
| `access_log` | `access.log` | File receiving HTTP access entries. |
| `error_log` | `error.log` | File receiving error messages. |
| `debug_log` | `debug.log` | File receiving debug output. |
| `debug_level` | `1` | Debug verbosity level (`1`â€“`4`). |
| `syslog_enabled` | `false` | Enable forwarding to a syslog server. |
| `syslog_host` | `localhost` | Hostname or IP of the syslog server. |
| `syslog_port` | `514` | Syslog server port. |
| `syslog_protocol` | `udp` | Transport protocol (`udp` or `tcp`). |

When syslog forwarding is enabled, messages are still written to the
local log files in addition to being sent to the remote server.

## Status Log

Scastd appends structured status entries to `/var/log/scastd/status.json`.
Each line is a JSON object with the following schema:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `timestamp` | UTC time in ISO&nbsp;8601 format. |
| `action` | Origin of the entry (`poll` or `api`). |
| `result` | Outcome such as `ok`, `error`, or HTTP status code. |
| `metadata` | Additional context for the action. |

Rotation of `status.json` uses the existing `log_max_size` and
`log_retention` settings from `scastd.conf`.
