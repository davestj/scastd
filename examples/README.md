# HTTP API and Database Insertion Example

This directory contains a small Python script that fetches JSON data from a public HTTP API and stores it in a SQLite database.

## Usage

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 api_db_example.py
```

The script downloads a sample post from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` and inserts it into `example.db`. After running, it prints the inserted row.
